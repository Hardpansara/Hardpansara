# 👋 Hey, I’m Hard Pansara

I'm someone who believes in the power of **curiosity and creativity to solve problems**.  
I explore the intersection of **cybersecurity**, **embedded systems**, **AI**, and **network awareness** to build tools that not only work — but **teach**, **protect**, and **empower**.

---

## 🛠️ What I Do

- 🧰 Build privacy-focused security tools like **Network Guardian Toolkit**
- 📡 Create embedded security gadgets (Evil Twin simulations, 2.4 GHz jammers, Wi-Fi pentest devices)
- 🔐 Educate others on ethical hacking and network security practices
- 💻 Develop Web3 apps (wallets, multi-chain tools) with secure authentication
- 🤖 Learn and apply Machine Learning — from foundational concepts to real-world use

---

## 🧪 Projects I'm Proud Of

- **[GearMask Wallet](https://github.com/Hardpansara/GearMask):**  
  A secure Ethereum wallet built in Flutter with multi-network support and full on-device encryption.

- **[Network Guardian Toolkit](https://github.com/Hardpansara/Network-security-toolkit):**  
  A full-stack tool to scan, monitor, and secure wireless networks — made for both techies and non-techies.

- **[Wi-Fi Penetration Tool](https://github.com/Hardpansara/esp32-wifi-penetration-tool)**  
  ESP32-based Wi-Fi penetration tool. 

- **[WeatherApp](https://github.com/Hardpansara/Weather-App):**  
  Stay ahead of the skies – real-time weather updates at your fingertips.

## 🔐 Philosophy

> "Security should be **understandable**, **accessible**, and **proactive** — not just reactive."

I love building things that:
- Reveal what’s happening in the network
- Help people **see risks before they hit**
- Encourage ethical hacking and responsible knowledge sharing

---

## 📚 Currently Exploring

- ✨ Ensemble learning and model optimization in Machine Learning
- 🧬 Secure Web3 authentication flows
- 🧠 Real-time network anomaly detection techniques
- ⚡ Low-level Wi-Fi stack manipulation using ESP chips
